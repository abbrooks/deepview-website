      About Us Page

Our founder put 15 global banks and asset managers in a room together with the FCA in 2013, which led to the inception of the ‘Social Media Charter’. The ‘Social Media Charter’ soon grew into a fully fledged fintech company, ‘Social Media Compliance (SMC)’ which later rebranded to ‘DeepView’ in 2018.

During this period, Catherine Parry has held her title as a ‘Young Global Leader’ for the World Economic Forum 4 years running. Catherine has always been entrepreneurial, having started her first business at just 16 years of age. As Catherine’s first business became more mature and began to run itself, Catherine then founded ‘Templars Communications’ - a successful PR company specialising in the financial and regulatory sectors.

Meanwhile, momentum was building for SMC. Catherine eventually decided to exit Templars in October 2017 (remaining as a Senior Advisor).

DeepView as we know it today….
