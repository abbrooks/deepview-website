    <h2>Corporate History</h2>
    <div>
      Our founder put 15 global banks and asset managers in a room together with the FCA in 2013, which led to the inception of the ‘Social Media Charter’. The ‘Social Media Charter’ soon grew into a fully fledged fintech company, ‘Social Media Compliance (SMC)’ which later rebranded to ‘DeepView’ in 2018.

      During this period, Catherine Parry has held her title as a ‘Young Global Leader’ for the World Economic Forum 4 years running. Catherine has always been entrepreneurial, having started her first business at just 16 years of age. As Catherine’s first business became more mature and began to run itself, Catherine then founded ‘Templars Communications’ - a successful PR company specialising in the financial and regulatory sectors.

      Meanwhile, momentum was building for SMC. Catherine eventually decided to exit Templars in October 2017 (remaining as a Senior Advisor).

      DeepView as we know it today….

          <h3>Job Role</h3>
          We have the ideal opportunity for a self-motivated individual looking for a multi-faceted role, located in Central London. The role will consist of working primarily with the CEO/Founder, but will involve regular contact with the team members and tech development team too. DeepView is currently a small team, which will allow exposure to all areas of the business. There will be opportunities to develop and grow within the company. Experience of supporting an entrepreneur or working at an early stage start-up would be beneficial.

          <h3>About Us</h3>
            DeepView is the world’s first image recognition machine learning tool for digital compliance and data breaches. Used by some of the world’s largest global banks and regulators already, including Federal Reserve Bank of NY, European Central Bank as well as JP Morgan, Bank of America and Barclays, the SaaS licence is being bought by Chief Compliance Officers wanting a holistic solution to data and compliance risk, that employees pose on their personal social media. The machine learning algorithm DeepView uses has been built over two years, based on the global regulatory laws including the SEC Safeguards Rule, the FCA’s Senior Managers Regime and hundreds of relevant others, as they apply to online use. It is why the regulators feel confident enough in the licence to use DeepView too. The software being built will also be offered to employees to help notify staff when they post an image which risks confidential information around their own personal identity.
