      <h2>Training & eLearning</h2>

        DeepView is a globally recognized provider of innovative compliance training and eLearning modules that raise awareness of the importance of using social media compliantly in the workplace.

        DeepView’s trainers and facilitators will travel to your organization and deliver impactful training programs in your chosen language. Training for graduates is particularly popular worldwide, with many global banks opting for DeepView’s unique offering year-on-year for their annual intake of new graduate staff and interns.

        All of DeepView’s products can be supported with fun eLearning animations that are proven to raise awareness and instill culture change in a short timeframe. Effective eLearning materials improve engagement with employees and also increase learner outcomes, with employees more likely to remember and adhere to important compliance directives delivered in this format.

        We also provide bespoke stand alone eLearning modules and animations that can be used to notify staff of changes in company policies or other internal news items, seamlessly circulating pivotal information in a unique, simple and fun format. Simplicity is at the heart of our solution.
