      <h2>Encrypted channel recording</h2>

      DeepView’s innovative platform records and archives conversations across encrypted social media channels on personal (BYOD) and corporate devices. Patent-pending technology enables your employees to use popular communication channels such as WhatsApp, WeChat and LinkedIn compliantly.

      Our monitoring platform helps you to meet ever-changing global compliance and regulatory standards, without affecting your team’s ability to communicate freely across social media platforms that are vital to their productivity. This is the only platform able to record, archive and create alerts for data-sensitive messages containing photos, videos and text (including emojis).

      In order to meet GDPR standards, personal chats can be excluded from recording. The DeepView monitoring platform is slick, simple and easy to use. Simplicity is at the heart of our solution.
